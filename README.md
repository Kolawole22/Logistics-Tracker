# Logistics Tracker

A React Native mobile application for tracking logistics and shipments, built with Expo and TypeScript. Currently using sample data for demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Package tracking dashboard with real-time status updates
- Detailed package information view
- Status update functionality
- Customizable settings with dynamic font scaling
- Modern, accessible UI design
- Cross-platform support (iOS & Android)

## Current Implementation

This is a demonstration version that uses sample data to showcase the functionality. The app includes:

- Pre-populated package data for testing and demonstration
- Simulated status updates
- Mock tracking information
- Sample delivery routes and timestamps

To implement with real data, you would need to:

1. Replace the mock data in `contexts/PackagesContext` with your API integration
2. Update the data models to match your backend schema
3. Implement proper authentication if required
4. Add real-time updates for package status changes
